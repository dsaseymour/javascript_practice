/*
The directions function takes in the arguments using the spread operator. The first
argument is assigned to the start variable. The last argument is assigned to a finish
variable using Array.reverse. We then use the length of the arguments array to display
how many towns weâ€™re going through. The number of stops is the length of the
arguments array minus the finish stop. This provides incredible flexibility because
we could use the directions function to handle any number of stops.
